# Running the Notebook

### Virtual Environment

I strongly recommend using a virtual environment when installing the dependencies. Virtual environments help you keep separate python installation and work on different projects on the same computer without installing dependencies globally.

To install a virtual environment run:

```virtualenv <name_of_venv>```

The instructions can also be found [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

From there activate the virtual environment by running:

```source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate```

You should now see your terminal begin with the name of the virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies run:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

### Run Jupyter

In the directory where the jupyter notebook is located run:

```jupyter notebook```

When jupyter launches open the notebook titled: `ALY6110.70531_Assignment3_Craig_Perkins_EDA.ipynb`
